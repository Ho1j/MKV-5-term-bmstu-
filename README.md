# First github repo
I'm studying combinatorial computing methods at uni, at the same time I'm taking something like "web on c#" courses and now I'm learning markdown, so I decided to combine it all and create a repository with my labs.

We code labs on C++. Yeach folder has code, lab report and lab task.
